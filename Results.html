Results
After all was said and done our neural network did not perform better than any existing technique. We attribute this mostly to lack of knowledge about TensorFlow and lack of time to learn all of the ins and outs of it. 

The predicted pixels for our images appeared to be randomly made and did not account for boundary edge direction as we had hoped. The randomness of the result makes us believe that we were not using a viable NN configuration or training algorithm, or we may not have trained the network on enough images. We still believe that this technique will work in theory, but we were unable to make it work ourselves.

Problems Encountered

The main issues we came across were in the implementation of the neural network. We decided early on to use TensorFlow and struggled probably too much to get it to work. In hindsight we probably should have explored other options for our neural network when we would have still had time to switch over. We donâ€™t believe that there is anything inherently wrong with TensorFlow that prevents it from solving this problem, but our knowledge is limited on how to use its capabilities.

We ran into a few other issues along the way. It took us a while to realize that we should be using grayscale images, so that set us back when we had to recreate the datasets. The Fourier Transform of a colored image has three dimensions, so we had a lot of confusion for a while as to why formats were messed up and why the matrix dimensions were off. We solved these issues by using grayscale images for the Fourier Transformations.
