<h1>Results</h1>
  After all was said and done our neural network did not perform better than any existing technique. We attribute this mostly to lack of knowledge about TensorFlow and lack of time to learn all of the ins and outs of it. 

  The predicted pixels for our images appeared to be randomly made and did not account for boundary edge direction as we had hoped. The randomness of the result makes us believe that we were not using a viable NN configuration or training algorithm, or we may not have trained the network on enough images. We still believe that this technique will work in theory, but we were unable to make it work ourselves.
